        <p>I recently had my son’s 5th birthday
party at Mountain Kim Martial Arts. Everything was so interactive, even the parents were interested in what was going on! The children were very excited to participate. They learned martial arts moves, did obstacles, and even broke boards. The party allowed plenty of time for food and cake. That day was a lot of fun. I definitely would plan a party there again!</p>

        <p>      We had a great time at Mountain Kim!
They kept the kids busy with games and
obstacle courses and were so friendly! The kids
had lots of fun! And my son got to cut the
cake with a sword, which he thought was
awesome! I would recommend
Mountain Kim 100%!</p>
